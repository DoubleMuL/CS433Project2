## Methond Description
This is an implementation of Mask R-CNN method for yeast cell image segmentation. The model generates segmentation masks for each instance of yeast cell in the image. The source of this implementation is given by: https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN.

## Instruction
### Requirements
- python 3.7, keras 2.2.0, tensorflow 1.13.1 
- other common packages listed in requirements.txt

## Folders and Files
- `codes`: contains python code developed for the project
  - `yeastSegHelpers`: contains helper file for segmentaion, tile and quality measurement
  - `train.py`: run this file to train the model
  - `detection.py`: run this file to apply the trained model to given image files in `dataset\test\frame` and save the generated mask in              `dataset\test\mask\results.tif`
  - `evaluation.py`: evaluation the generated mask by `detection.py`
- `logs`: contains logs of training
- `models`: contains models generated by `train.py`
- `dataset`: contains all the dataset for training, validation and test.
  - `test`: constains dataset for test, please place original frames in `frame` folder.
  - `train`: constains dataset for training, please place original frames in `frame` folder, and corresponding mask in `mask` folder
  - `validation`: constains dataset for validtion, please place original frames in `frame` folder, and corresponding mask in `mask` folder
